# Introduction

The automotive landscape is undergoing a profound shift towards sustainable and eco-friendly transportation, and at the forefront of this evolution is the increasing adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). Washington, as a state actively embracing this change, provides an ideal viewpoint for our investigation. The emergence and development of electric vehicles not only have a significant impact on the automotive market but also bring changes to environmental sustainability, infrastructure development, and the entire automotive industry. Our objective is to contribute to the analysis of the electric vehicle market in Washington State, enriching the discussion on sustainable mobility based on the electric vehicle population dataset in WA.
