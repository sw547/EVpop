    "text": "1 Introduction\nThe automotive landscape is undergoing a profound shift towards sustainable and eco-friendly transportation, and at the forefront of this evolution is the increasing adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). Washington, as a state actively embracing this change, provides an ideal viewpoint for our investigation. The emergence and development of electric vehicles not only have a significant impact on the automotive market but also bring changes to environmental sustainability, infrastructure development, and the entire automotive industry. Our objective is to contribute to the analysis of the electric vehicle market in Washington State, enriching the discussion on sustainable mobility based on the electric vehicle population dataset in WA.\nQuestions of Interest:\n\nTrends in Electric Vehicle Adoption\n\nWhat patterns and trends characterize the adoption of electric vehicles in Washington state over the years?\nAre the patterns and trends the same for both plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) and battery electric vehicle (BEV)?\n\nPopular Electric Vehicle Models/Makes\n\nWhich electric vehicle brands (makes) and models have gained prominence in Washington state?\nDoes consumer preference align with certain characteristics, such as brand reputation?\nAre the popular brands different for PHEV and BEV? What about for different counties within Washington state?\n\nDistribution of Electric Range\n\nHow is the electric range distributed among the electric vehicles?\nIs it correlated with EV type? Is it different for PHEV and BEV?\n\nPrice Analysis\n\nHow is the base Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) distributed among the electric vehicles?\nWhat is the relationship between the base MSRP and other features, such as electric range or model year?"

    "text": "2.1 Description\nIn this project, we will use three datasets about electric vehicles in Washington State. All datasets are collected and maintained by Washington State Department of Licensing, and are published on Washington Open Data. The three datasets are created on April 16, 2019, May 8, 2019, and June 1, 2020 respectively and are updated monthly with the latest update on November 15th.\nThe first dataset Electric Vehicle Population Data contains information about current electric vehicle registrations in WA. It has 159,467 rows each representing a registered electric vehicle, and 17 columns including VIN (1-10), County, City, State, Postal Code, Model Year, Make, Model, Electric Vehicle Type, Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility, Electric Range, Base MSRP, Legislative District, DOL Vehicle ID, Vehicle Location, Electric Utility, and 2020 Census Tract. The dataset is clean except for some undocumented entries of Electric Range and Base MSRP represented as 0, which clearly doesn’t make sense. We will analyze this further in section 2.3. Note that some vehicles registered in WA are from other states. When doing visualizations we filter those out and only focus on electric vehicles in WA.\nThe second dataset Electric Vehicle Population Size History contains monthly updated total count of Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle, Battery Electric Vehicle, and Electric Vehicle Total registered in WA from January, 2017 to October, 2023. It has 82 rows and 4 columns. This dataset is ready-to-use as it has no issues.\nThe third dataset Electric Vehicle Population Size History By County contains monthly updated count of Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle, Battery Electric Vehicle, Electric Vehicle Total, Non-Electric Vehicle Total, and Electric Vehicle Percentage of different counties from February, 2017 to September, 2023. It has 19,429 rows and 10 Columns. This dataset is also ready-to-use as it has no issues. Note that similar to the first dataset, this one also contains vehicles from other states registered in WA . When doing visualizations we filter those out and only focus on electric vehicles in WA as well.\nOur data source allows us to download csv files which we will then upload to our github repository for further usage."

A cleveland dot plot is also suitable for displaying the ranking of different makes.\nWe would then draw a faceted bar chart for the count of all makes at county level.\nAfter that, we would generate a list of interested makes. Therefore, we are able to take a closer look at customer’s preference by ploting a cleveland dot plot of models for subset of makes.\n\nDistribution of Electric Range\n\nWe would also address this question using Electric Vehicle Population Data.\nWe intend to create a boxplot for electric range for all EVs. \nA faceted boxplot for different EV type (PHEV & BEV) is also necessary to explore the difference.\n\nPrice Analysis\n\nSimilarly, we would use Electric Vehicle Population Datato investigate this question.\nWe prepare to draw a boxplot and/or a ridgeline plot for MSRP of EV, as well as a faceted plot for PHEV and BEV. \nMoreover, we hope to graph a scatterplot of MSRP vs. electric range, separated by EV type."

However, we notice entries with value of “0” for Base MSRP and Electric Range, which clearly does NOT make sense and thus should be treated as missing values. From the graph we can tell that other variables of interest have no missing values. Almost all values of Base MSRP are missing and about a half of Electric Range values are missing, with an extremely low percentage of rows not missing values from any columns. We also notice that for some specific model, we have instances for which Base MSRP is missing and instances for which Base MSRP is not missing, similar with Electric Range. We address this issue when pre-processing the data, by filling known missing values using non-missing instances and filling unknown missing values with data provided by Kelley Blue Book.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere’s no missing value in Electric Vehicle Population Size History By County dataset, as we can tell from the graph."

This trend is evident in the first graph, which illustrates an increasing growth rate each year. Additionally, both Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) and Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) have seen a rise in their numbers. However, the growth in BEV numbers has outpaced that of PHEVs.\nAlong with surge in overall EV numbers, there has been a notable shift in the composition of EV types. The proportion of BEVs has grown significantly, particularly in 2023. Over the last seven years, BEVs have not only increased in count but also consistently maintained a higher percentage compared to PHEVs.\n\n\n3.1.2 How Many EV are there in Each County?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(sf)\n\nev_count_per_county &lt;- evpop %&gt;%\n  group_by(County) %&gt;%\n  summarise(EV_Count = n())\n\ncounties &lt;- st_read(\"/Users/wsqia/OneDrive/文档/547files/Columbia/courses/STAT5702 EDAV/Final Project/WA_County_Boundaries.dbf\", quiet = TRUE)\n\ncounties &lt;- counties %&gt;%\n  select(JURISDIC_2, geometry)\nnames(counties) &lt;- c(\"County\", \"geometry\")\n  \ngeo_data &lt;- merge(counties, ev_count_per_county, by = 'County', all.x = TRUE)\n\nggplot(data = geo_data) +\n  geom_sf(aes(fill = EV_Count), color = NA) +  \n  geom_sf(color = \"darkblue\", fill = NA, size = 1) + \n  geom_sf_text(aes(label = County), size = 3, check_overlap = TRUE) +  \n  scale_fill_distiller(palette = \"Purples\", direction = 1) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(),  \n        axis.title.y = element_blank(),  \n        axis.text.x = element_blank(),   \n        axis.text.y = element_blank(),  \n        panel.grid.major = element_blank(),  \n        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n        plot.title = element_text(size = 20)) + \n  labs(title = 'Number of EVs by County in Washington State', \n       fill = 'EV Count')\n\n\n\n\n\nKing County stands out for its high number of electric vehicles (EVs) compared to other counties in Washington. Neighboring Snohomish and Pierce Counties also demonstrate a significant number of EV adoptions, with Clark County following closely in terms of EV counts.\n link to source\nIn terms of population, King County leads with 2,269,675 residents, while Pierce and Snohomish rank second and third with populations of 921,130 and 827,957, respectively. These counties, particularly King, Pierce, and Clark, have population densities exceeding 500 people per square mile. Snohomish County, with a density between 200 and 499.9 people per square mile, also exhibits a notable concentration of population. This pattern suggests a potential correlation between population density and the number of EV adoptions. However, further research is required to establish a definitive correlation or causative relationship between these factors."

The first cluster is centered at approximately 50 miles, indicating a significant number of EVs with a lower electric range. The second, more dispersed cluster spans from 200 to 400 miles, suggesting a wide array of EVs offering mid to high electric range capabilities. Apart from these, there is an exceptional category exceeding 500 miles, which is an outlier. The following boxplot shows a more nuanced analysis of electric range distribution.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(evpop, aes(x = Type, y = Range)) +\n  geom_boxplot(orientation = \"vertical\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Electric Range for BEVs and PHEVs\",\n       x = \"Vehicle Type\",\n       y = \"Electric Range\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe boxplot analysis indicates that PHEVs primarily constitute the first cluster with a narrower range, reflecting less variation in their electric range. With a median of approximately 25 miles, PHEVs generally offer a shorter electric range than BEVs, which aligns with their dual-energy design incorporating gasoline. Additionally, the presence of outliers suggests that some PHEVs have much higher electric range than the majority.\nConversely, BEVs, which make up the second cluster, display a much wider range, indicative of a broader spectrum of electric capabilities. The median range for BEVs is just under 300 miles, significantly surpassing that of PHEVs, which reflects their reliance solely on battery power. Notably, the BEV distribution includes outliers on both the lower and higher ends, pointing to exceptional models deviating from the typical range."
