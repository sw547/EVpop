    "text": "2.1 Description\nIn this project, we will use two datasets about electric vehicles in Washing State. Both datasets are collected and maintained by Washington State Department of Licensing, and are published on Washington Open Data. The two datasets are created on April 16, 2019 and May 8, 2019 respectively and are updated monthly with the latest update on November 15th.\nThe first dataset Electric Vehicle Population Data contains information about current electric vehicle registrations in WA. It has 159,467 rows each representing a registered electric vehicle, and 17 columns including VIN (1-10), County, City, State, Postal Code, Model Year, Make, Model, Electric Vehicle Type, Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility, Electric Range, Base MSRP, Legislative District, DOL Vehicle ID, Vehicle Location, Electric Utility, and 2020 Census Tract. The dataset is clean except for some undocumented entries of Electric Range and Base MSRP represented as 0, which clearly doesn’t make sense. We will analyze this further in section 2.3.\nThe second dataset Electric Vehicle Population Size History contains monthly updated total count of Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle, Battery Electric Vehicle, and Electric Vehicle Total in WA from January, 2017 to Octobor, 2023. It has 82 rows and 4 columns. This dataset is ready-to-use as it has no issues.\nOur data source allows us to download csv files which we will then upload to our github repository for further usage."

    "text": "2.3 Missing value analysis\n\n\n\n\n\nThere’s no missing value in Electric Vehicle Population Size History dataset, as we can tell from the graph.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs for Electric Vehicle Population Data dataset, it might appear at first that missing values only exist in columns that we’re not interested in. However, we notice entries with value of “0” for Base MSRP and Electric Range, which clearly does NOT make sense and thus should be treated as missing values. From the graph we can tell that other variables of interest have no missing values. Almost all values of Base MSRP are missing and about a half of Electric Range values are missing, with a extremly low percentage of rows not missing values from any columns. We also notice that for some specific model, we have instances for which Base MSRP is missing and instances for which Base MSRP is not missing, similar with Electric Range. We will address this issue when preprocessing the data, by filling known missing values using non-missing instances and filling unknown missing values with data provided by official websites of vehicle brands."
