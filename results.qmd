```

Electric vehicle ownership surged remarkably from 22,425 units in January 2017 to 159,467 by October 2023, marking a more than seven fold increase. This trend is evident in the first graph, which illustrates an increasing growth rate each year. Additionally, both Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) and Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) have seen a rise in their numbers. However, the growth in BEV numbers has outpaced that of PHEVs.

Along with surge in overall EV numbers, there has been a notable shift in the composition of EV types. The proportion of BEVs has grown significantly, particularly in 2023. Over the last seven years, BEVs have not only increased in count but also consistently maintained a higher percentage compared to PHEVs.

```

*Note: Due to the disproportionately high number of EVs in King County, presenting the counts for other counties on the same scale is challenging. To address this, a graph utilizing a logarithmic scale for the counts has been provided for clearer comparison.*

King County stands out for its high number of electric vehicles (EVs) compared to other counties in Washington. Neighboring Snohomish and Pierce Counties also demonstrate a significant number of EV adoptions, with Clark County following closely in terms of EV counts. Additionally, it is worth noting that Garfield County has a distinctly lower EV adoption, highlighting a sharp contrast within the state.

![Outsourced Graph: Population Density in Washington State](https://github.com/sw547/EVpop/blob/main/data/Population_Density_in_WA.png?raw=true) [link to source](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/state-by-state/washington-population-change-between-census-decade.html#:~:text=Race%20and%20ethnicity%20(White%20alone,%25%2C%20up%20from%2054.9%25).)

In terms of population, King County leads with 2,269,675 residents, while Pierce and Snohomish rank second and third with populations of 921,130 and 827,957, respectively. These counties, particularly King, Pierce, and Clark, have population densities exceeding 500 people per square mile. Snohomish County, with a density between 200 and 499.9 people per square mile, also exhibits a notable concentration of population. This pattern suggests a potential correlation between population density and the number of EV adoptions. However, further research is required to establish a definitive correlation or causative relationship between these factors.

## Popular EV Make

### What are the most popular electric vehicle makes in Washington State?

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height=15}
Make_Count <- evp%>%
  group_by(Make) %>%
  summarise(Count = n()) %>%
  arrange(Count)
Make_Count$Make <- factor(Make_Count$Make, levels = Make_Count$Make)

Make_Count_BEV <- evp%>%
  filter(Type=="Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV)") %>%
  group_by(Make) %>%
  summarise(Count = n()) %>%
  arrange(Count)
Make_Count_BEV$Make <- factor(Make_Count_BEV$Make, levels = Make_Count_BEV$Make)

Make_Count_PHEV <- evp%>%
  filter(Type=="Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV)") %>%
  group_by(Make) %>%
  summarise(Count = n()) %>%
  arrange(Count)
Make_Count_PHEV$Make <- factor(Make_Count_PHEV$Make, levels = Make_Count_PHEV$Make)


ggplot(Make_Count,aes(x =Make, y = Count)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#7eb0d5", show.legend = FALSE) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(text=element_text(size=15),element_line(size=0.5)) +
  labs(x = "Make", y = "Count", title = "EV Make Popularity in WA")

ggplot(Make_Count_BEV,aes(x =Make, y = Count)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#fdcce5", show.legend = FALSE) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(text=element_text(size=15),element_line(size=0.5)) +
  labs(x = "Make", y = "Count", title = "BEV Make Popularity in WA")

ggplot(Make_Count_PHEV,aes(x =Make, y = Count)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#beb9db", show.legend = FALSE) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(text=element_text(size=15),element_line(size=0.5)) +
  labs(x = "Make", y = "Count", title = "PHEV Make Popularity in WA")
```

Not surprisingly, Tesla as a brand known by almost everyone in the world is the most popular electric vehicle make in Washington State.

### What about models?

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=5, fig.height=20}
Model_Count <- evp %>%
  group_by(Make, Model) %>%
  summarise(Count=n(), .groups="drop") %>%
  arrange(Make, desc(Count))

Model_Count$Make <- factor(Model_Count$Make, levels = Make_Count$Make)

Model_Count <- Model_Count %>%
  arrange(desc(Make))

ggplot(Model_Count, aes(x = Count, y = reorder(Model, Count))) +
  geom_point(color="#4421af", size=1.2) +
  facet_grid(fct_rev(Make)~.,scale="free_y",space="free_y")+
  theme_linedraw() +
  theme(text=element_text(size=6),element_line(size=0.3))+
  labs(x = "Count", y = "Model", title = "EV Model Popularity in WA facet by Make")

```

### County level? Do people have the same preference?

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| fig-width: 12
#| fig-height: 8

top_makes_by_county <- evpop %>%
  group_by(County, Make) %>%
  summarise(Count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(Count)) %>%
  group_by(County) %>%
  slice_max(Count, n = 3) %>%
  ungroup()

ggplot(top_makes_by_county, aes(x = Make, y = Count, fill = Make)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#fd7f6f", "#7ebed5", "#b2e961", "#bd7ebe", "#ffb55a", "#ffee65", "#beb9db", "#fdcce5")) +
  facet_wrap(~ County, scales = "free_y") +  
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(),
      plot.title = element_text(size = 20)) + 
  labs(title = "Top 3 Popular Car Brands in Each County",
       x = "Brand (Make)",
       y = "Frequency")
```

*Note: In the graphs for some counties, four brands are depicted. This occurs when there is an equal count for the third-ranking brand, resulting in a tie.*

It is not surprising that Tesla dominants as the leading EV brand in nearly all counties. Also, Chevrolet consistently ranks within the top three brands in the majority of counties, reflecting its widespread popularity among both BEV and PHEV owners in Washington State, as the earlier bar charts have illustrated. Intriguingly, despite Nissan being the second most favored EV brand statewide, it only features in the top three brands in about half of the counties, suggesting regional preferences that diverge from the overall state trend. Noticeably, Garfield County stands out with only four EVs registered, which is not enough to establish a trend.

## Price

### We can't ignore the price! What is the distribution of EV base MSRP in Washington State?

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# one single entry of very high MSRP causes problem in histogram, thus topcoding
# evp%>%
#   arrange(desc(MSRP)) %>%
#   select(MSRP)
evp_msrp_tc <- evp %>%
  mutate(MSRP_tc = ifelse(MSRP > 100000, 100001, MSRP))

ggplot(evp_msrp_tc, aes(x = MSRP_tc)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10000, boundary= 10000, fill = "#7eb0d5",color="black",closed="right") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(10000, 110000, by=10000),
                     labels = c("10k","20k","30k","40k","50k",
                                "60k","70k","80k","90k","100k","inf")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Base MSRP ($)", y = "Count", title = "EV MSRP Frenquency in WA")
```

### Is there any noticable difference in distribution of prices between PHEV and BEV?

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=15, fig.height=5}

# since one extreme outlier makes the boxplot hard to read, we adjust y-axis limits)
ggplot(evp, aes(x = reorder(Type,MSRP, median), y = MSRP)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = c("#beb9db", "#fdcce5")) +
  coord_flip()+
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(text=element_text(size=20))+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 220000, by=20000),
                     labels = c("0","20k","40k","60k","80k","100k",
                                "120k","140k","160k","180k","200k","220k"),
                     limits = c(0,220000)) +
  labs(x = "EV Type", y = "Base MSRP ($)", title = "Multiple Boxplot of MSRP according to EV Type")

```

## Electric Range

### How's the Electric Range for EVs? Are they the same for BEVs and PHEVs?

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
ggplot(evpop, aes(x = Range)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 50, boundary = 0, fill = "#7eb0d5", color = "#115f9a", closed="right") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 500, by = 50)) + 
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Histogram of Electric Range of EVs",
       x = "Electric Range",
       y = "Count")
```

From the histogram above, it's apparent that the electric range of EVs predominantly falls into two groupings. The first cluster is centered at approximately 50 miles, indicating a significant number of EVs with a lower electric range. The second, more dispersed cluster spans from 200 to 400 miles, suggesting a wide array of EVs offering mid to high electric range capabilities. Apart from these, there is an exceptional category exceeding 500 miles, which is an outlier.

This distribution suggests a trend toward consumer preference for EVs within these two distinct range categories. Notably, there are relatively few purchases of EVs with the highest range capabilities, which may be due to limiting factors such as cost or low supply due to current technological constraints.

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
ggplot(evpop, aes(x = reorder(Type, Range, median), y = Range)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = c("#beb9db", "#fdcce5")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Electric Range for BEVs and PHEVs",
       x = "Vehicle Type",
       y = "Electric Range (miles)")
```

The boxplot analysis indicates that BEVs primarily constitute the second cluster in the histogram, with a wider range, reflecting higher variation in their electric range. The median range for BEVs is just under 300 miles, significantly surpassing that of PHEVs, which reflects their reliance solely on battery power. Notably, the BEV distribution includes outliers on both the lower and higher ends, pointing to exceptional models deviating from the typical range.

Conversely, PHEVs, which make up the first cluster in the histogram, display a much smaller range, indicative of a narrower spectrum of electric capabilities. With a median of approximately 25 miles, PHEVs generally offer a shorter electric range than BEVs, which aligns with their dual-energy design incorporating gasoline. However, it is quite surprising that half of the hybrid electric vehicles can BARELY drive from Manhattan to Long Beach, solely on its battery. Additionally, the presence of outliers suggests that a few PHEVs have much higher electric range than the majority.

## Price vs. Electric Range

### Do we get more Electric Range if we're paying more for the EV?

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# When dealing with correlation of MSRP and EV Range, we drop duplicates
msrp_range <- evp %>%
  select(Type, MSRP, Range) %>%
  distinct(MSRP, Range, .keep_all=TRUE)

# we adjust limits of x-axis here to prevent that one extreme outlier
# from making the graph hard to read
ggplot(msrp_range, aes(x = MSRP, y = Range, color=Type)) +
  geom_point(size=1.2,alpha=0.8) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 220000, by=20000),
                     labels = c("0","20k","40k","60k","80k","100k",
                                "120k","140k","160k","180k","200k","220k"),
                     limits = c(0,220000)) +
  labs(x = "Base MSRP ($)", y = "Electric Range (miles)", title = "EV MSRP vs. Electric Range") +
  scale_color_manual(values=c("#fdcce5","#beb9db"))

```
